            <p> The rose is a type of flowering shrub. Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa.
                There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. 
                The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or 
                yellow rose and sometimes white or purple rose.
                Roses belong to the family of plants called Rosaceae. 
                All roses were originally wild: they grew in North America, Europe, northwest Africa and 
                many parts of Asia and Oceania. There are over 100 different species of roses. 
                The wild rose species can be grown in gardens, but most garden roses are cultivars, 
                which have been selected by people.
                Over hundreds of years they have been specially bred to produce a wide variety of 
                growing habits and a broad range of colours from dark red to white including 
                as well yellow and a bluish/lilac colour. Many roses have a strong, pleasant scent.
                Most roses have thorns on their stems. This is a common defense system in plants.
                Rose bushes are able to live in a wide variety of conditions. </p>

        <p>Aster is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. 
            Its circumscription has been narrowed, and it now encompasses around 170 species,
            all but one of which are restricted to Eurasia; many species formerly in Aster are 
            now in other genera of the tribe Astereae. Aster amellus is the type species of the 
            genus and the family Asteraceae.
            The name Aster comes from the Ancient Greek word ἀστήρ (astḗr),
            meaning "star", referring to the shape of the flower head. 
            Many species and a variety of hybrids and varieties are popular as garden plants 
            because of their attractive and colourful flowers. 
            'Aster' species are used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species
            Asters can grow in all hardiness zones.</p>

        <p> Gardenia jasminoides, commonly known as gardenia, is an evergreen flowering plant 
            in the coffee family Rubiaceae. It is native to parts of South-East Asia. 
            Wild plants range from 30 centimetres to 3 metres (about 1 to 10 feet) in height. 
            They have a rounded habit with very dense branches with opposite leaves that are lanceolate-oblong, 
            leathery or gathered in groups on the same node and by a dark green, shiny and slightly waxy surface 
            and prominent veins.
            With its shiny green leaves and heavily fragrant white summer flowers, 
            it is widely used in gardens in warm temperate and subtropical climates. 
            It also is used as a houseplant in temperate climates. 
            It has been in cultivation in China for at least a thousand years,
             and it was introduced to English gardens in the mid-18th century.
              Many varieties have been bred for horticulture, with low-growing, and large, 
              and long-flowering forms.</p>
